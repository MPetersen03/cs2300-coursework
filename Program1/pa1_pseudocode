Part 1
  Create Matrix:
    Create matrices based on initial value, increase value, rows, columns, and whether to do rows or columns first
    do this by creating a 2d array and inserting values based on a nested loop using 2 for loops
    
  Write matrix to txt
    Open text and then go through nested for loop and write matrix values to txt file

  main
    create 4 matrices
    write matrices to txt file
    print first and last name with how many initials are in both


Part 2
  Read Matrix from txt
    read in txt file and covert it into a matrix(2d array)

  add matrices
    adds 2 matrices by going through each value and adding them together. making a third matrix
    check to see if matrices can be added together

  write matrix to txt
     Open text and then go through nested for loop and write matrix values to txt file

  main
    get 2 matrices from user
    put both matrices in add matrices function
    write new matrix to txt file

Part 3

  NOTE: I could not get numpy to work on my end, I tried many things including messaging the teacher and none of them have worked

  Read Matrix from txt
      read in txt file and covert it into a matrix(2d array) USING numpy.loadtxt()

  add matrices
    adds 2 matrices USING numpy.add()

  write matrix to txt
     Open text and write matrix to it USING numpy.tofile()

  main
    get 2 matrices from user
    put both matrices in add matrices function
    write new matrix to txt file
